# Stupid devops questions and answers

#### What should I do with poentry.lock file? Add to .gitignore or keep in .git?

No, you generally should not add the `.lock` file to your `.gitignore`. The `.lock` file is an important part of dependency management when you're using a tool like Poetry or Pipenv to manage your Python project's dependencies.

The `.lock` file contains detailed information about the specific versions of packages and dependencies that your project is using. It helps ensure that your project consistently uses the same package versions across different environments, preventing unexpected behavior or compatibility issues.

Here are a few reasons why you should include the `.lock` file in your version control system (e.g., Git):

1. **Dependency Reproducibility:** Including the `.lock` file allows anyone else working on your project to recreate the exact same development environment with the same package versions. This ensures consistent behavior across different development machines.

2. **Distributed Development:** If you're collaborating with others on the project, sharing the `.lock` file ensures that everyone is using the same package versions, reducing the chances of compatibility issues.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI):** CI/CD pipelines often rely on the `.lock` file to install the exact dependencies needed for testing and deployment. Including it in version control helps your CI system set up the correct environment.

4. **Documentation:** The `.lock` file serves as a form of documentation for your project's dependencies. Others can easily see which versions of packages your project relies on.

So, it's generally a good practice to commit the `.lock` file along with your `pyproject.toml` (in the case of Poetry) or `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (in the case of Pipenv) to your version control system. This ensures that the dependencies for your project are well-documented and reproducible.
